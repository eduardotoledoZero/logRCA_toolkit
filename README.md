# Log Analysis and Anomaly Detection
## 1. Overview
This repository is dedicated to the development and implementation of tools and techniques for log analysis and anomaly detection, similar to root cause analysis. My  goal is to provide a comprehensive solution for identifying and diagnosing issues within system logs, helping to maintain the reliability and performance of various applications and systems.



## 2. Approaches.

# 2.1 TF_ID Vectorizer

The first approach is to use the concept behing of TF_ID Vectorizer. This is merely a proof of concept

- Log Parsing and Preprocessing: Efficiently parse and preprocess log data from various sources to prepare it for analysis.

- Anomaly Detection: Utilize advanced algorithms and techniques to detect anomalies within log data, identifying potential issues or irregularities.

- Root Cause Analysis: Analyze anomalies to determine their root causes, providing insights into the underlying issues.
- Visualization Tools: Generate visualizations, such as word clouds, to help interpret and communicate log analysis results.
